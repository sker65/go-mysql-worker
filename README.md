# Demo in golang to use worker pool for mysql
Initially inspired by this medium article ... (was deleted meanwhile, maybe because of the lack of quality)

I tried to improve my go skills and added a few features:

 - better error handling
 - better concurrency control for quitting the workers
 - better sql performance by using batches

Still the code is not very clean, but it works.

Next thing is to provide better documentation or a small blog article.
